# Basic Rails 5 / Angular 4 token based authentication

I finished this demo with the intent to get better at user authentication with Angular and Rails.

Finished app based on the article here - https://medium.com/@avatsaev/angular-2-and-ruby-on-rails-user-authentication-fde230ddaed8

Uses Angular2 Token Service (https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-token) and DeviseTokenAuth (https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth) to manage authentication.
